## 📖 Project Overview

**redep** is a lightweight, secure Command Line Interface (CLI) designed to simplify remote deployment workflows. It solves the problem of "blind deployments" by establishing a real-time WebSocket connection between your local machine (or CI/CD runner) and your remote servers.

### Key Features

- **📺 Real-time Streaming**: Watch your deployment logs (stdout/stderr) stream live to your terminal.
- **🔒 Secure**: Uses Token-based authentication and strictly isolated command execution.
- **⚡ Multi-Server**: Manage multiple environments (Development, UAT, Production) from a single config.
- **🐳 Docker Ready**: Comes with a production-ready Docker image for instant server setup.
- **🛠️ Flexible**: Execute any command you define (`docker compose`, `kubectl`, shell scripts, etc.).

## 🚀 Installation

### npm Package (Client & Server)

Install globally to use the CLI on your local machine or server.

```bash
npm install -g redep
```

### Docker Image (Server Only)

Pull the official image for running the server component.

```bash
docker pull nafies1/redep:latest
```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Setting up the Server

The server is the agent that runs on your remote machine and executes the deployment commands.

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name redep-server \
  --restart always \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd):/app/workspace \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key \
  -e WORKING_DIR=/app/workspace \
  -e DEPLOYMENT_COMMAND="docker compose pull && docker compose up -d" \
  nafies1/redep:latest
```

#### Option B: Using npm & PM2

```bash
# Initialize configuration
redep init server
# Follow the prompts to set port, working dir, and secret key

# Start the server
redep start
```

### 2. Setting up the Client

The client runs on your local machine or CI pipeline.

```bash
# Initialize a server profile
redep init client
# ? Enter Server Name: prod
# ? Enter Server URL (Host): http://your-server-ip:3000
# ? Enter Secret Key: your-super-secret-key
```

### 3. Deploying

Trigger a deployment to your configured server.

```bash
redep deploy prod
```

You will see:
```text
(INFO) Connecting to http://your-server-ip:3000...
(SUCCESS) Connected to server. requesting deployment...
(INFO) [10:00:01 AM] Status: Deployment Started
(INFO) [10:00:02 AM] [STDOUT] Pulling images...
(INFO) [10:00:05 AM] [STDOUT] Container recreated.
(SUCCESS) [10:00:06 AM] Status: Deployment Completed
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

`redep` uses a hierarchical configuration system:
1.  **Environment Variables** (Highest Priority)
2.  **Config File** (Managed via CLI)

See [Advanced Configuration](docs/ADVANCED_CONFIG.md) for full details on environment variables and config management.

## 💻 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- Docker (for testing container builds)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nafies1/redep.git
    cd redep
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Link globally (optional):**
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

4.  **Run tests:**
    Currently, we rely on manual verification using the `test-target` directory.
    ```bash
    # Start server
    npm run start -- listen
    ```
